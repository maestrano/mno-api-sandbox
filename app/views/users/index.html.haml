      %h4 User Identification
      %br
      Before reading this part you should get familiar with the 
      = link_to "concept of groups", groups_path, target: "_blank"
      \.
      A user is an actual system user - there are no tricks on that. Having said that users can have multiple "identities" based on the groups they belong to. Or - if you prefer - you can say that a given user can be part of several collaboration groups.
      %br
      %br
      %b E.g: 
      John is part of group 1 and group 2 which are two different groups using mysuperhrsystem.com via Maestrano. John should therefore be able to collaborate with these two groups on mysuperhrsystem.com and see both groups data. 
      %br
      %br
      Easy? Well it actually depends on your application. Is your application able to link a given user to two different groups/organizations/collaboration groups/company account? 
      %br
      %br
      If yes, then it's easy! You just need to identify users based on their native universal id (uid - provided by Maestrano) then add them to each new group they join.
      %br
      %br
      If no, then don't worry we've got it covered. We give you the ability to create one system user per real user per group. For each user in a group we provide a set of composite universal id, username and email (called virtual_uid, virtual_username and virtual_email) that are unique across users and groups. So for any new group the native user joins you can use these details to create a whole new system user without worrying about multi-group management in your system. Easy as well! 
      %br
      %br
      Note that if you decide to use the "composite virtual_email", you will still need to capture the real email address of the user for sending emails.
